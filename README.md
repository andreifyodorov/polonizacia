An exercise in applying Polish orthography to Russian language

1. **Basic consonants** are `б`, `в`, `г`, `з`, `к`, `м`, `н`, `п`, `с`, `т`, `ф` represented as `b`, `w`, `g`, `z`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `s`, `t`, `f`.

  1.1. Basic consonants are considered **soft (palatalized) consonants** when followed by either a **iotized vowel** (`я`, `ё`, `ю`, `е`, `и`) or `ь`. Palatalized versions of consonants are represented by appending `i` or `j` to them, such as `бь` becomes `bi` midword, `bj` terminal; `би` becomes `bi`.

2. `д` is repesented as `d`, the soft version is `dzi` midword or `dz` terminal; `ди` becomes `dzi`.

3. `р` is represented as `r`, the soft version is `rz`. `ри` becomes `rzy`.

4. `л` is repesented as `ł`, the soft version is `l`.

3. **Basic vowels** are `а`, `о`, `у`, `э`, `ы` represented as `a`, `o`, `u`, `e`, `y`.

4. **Iot** sound in Russian is fluid and sticky, it is what makes consonants soft (palatalization). In cyrillic it is represented on its own as `й`, `ь`, `ъ`. As you can see with the soft consonants it can be represented as `i` or `j`, sometimes as `z` or `zi`.

5. **Always-soft consonants** are `ж`, `х`, `ц`, `ч`, `ш`, `щ` repesented as `ż`, `ch`, `c`, `cz`, `sz`, `szcz`.

7. By appending a basic vowel to Iot **iotized vowels** are produced. They are are `я`, `ё`, `ю`, `е`, `и`.

  7.1. In the beginning of a word the vowels are represented as `ja`, `jo`, `ju`, `je`, `i`.

  7.2. After a soft-consanant, `ь`/`ъ` (both represented as `j`) are represented as their basic counterparts `a`, `o`, `u`, `e`, `y` (e.g. `подъезд` => `podjezd`)
