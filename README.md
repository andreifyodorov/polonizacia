# polonizacyia
An exercise in applying Polish orthography to Russian language

**Basic consonants** are `б`, `в`, `г`, `з`, `к`, `л`, `м`, `н`, `п`, `с`, `т`, `ф` represented as `b`, `w`, `g`, `z`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `s`, `t`, `f`.

Basic consonsants can be made into **soft (palatalized) consonants** by appending `i` or `j` to them, such as `бь` becomes `bi` midword or `bj` when tailing.

**R-D** consonants are `р` and `д` represented as `r` and `d`. Their soft versions are represented as `rz` and `dzi` or `dz` when tailing.

**Iot** sound in Russian is fluid and sticky, it is what makes consonants soft (palatalization). In cyrillic it is represented on its own as `й`, `ь`, `ъ`. As you can see with the soft consonants it can be represented as `i` or `j`, sometimes as `z` or `zi`.

**Always-soft consonants** are `ж`, `х`, `ц`, `ч`, `ш`, `щ` repesented as `ż`, `ch`, `c`, `cz`, `sz`, `szcz`.

**Basic vowels** are `а`, `о`, `у`, `э`, `ы` represented as `a`, `o`, `u`, `e`, `y`.

By appending a basic vowel to Iot **iotized vowels** are produced. They are are `я`, `ё`, `ю`, `е`, `и`.
- In the beginning of a word the vowels are represented as `ja`, `jo`, `ju`, `je`, `i`.
- After a soft-consanant, `ь`/`ъ` (both represented as `j`) are represented as their basic counterparts `a`, `o`, `u`, `e`, `y` (e.g. `подъезд` => `podjezd`)
